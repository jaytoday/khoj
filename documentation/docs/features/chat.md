# Chat

You can configure Khoj to chat with you about anything. When relevant, it'll use any notes or documents you shared with it to respond.

### Overview
- Creates a personal assistant for you to inquire and engage with your notes
- You can choose to use Online or Offline Chat depending on your requirements
- Supports multi-turn conversations with the relevant notes for context
- Shows reference notes used to generate a response

### Setup (Self-Hosting)
#### Offline Chat
Offline chat stays completely private and works without internet using open-source models.

> **System Requirements**:
>  - Minimum 8 GB RAM. Recommend **16Gb VRAM**
>  - Minimum **5 GB of Disk** available
>  - A CPU supporting [AVX or AVX2 instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) is required
>  - A Mac M1+ or [Vulcan supported GPU](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/) should significantly speed up chat response times

1. Open your [Khoj offline settings](http://localhost:42110/server/admin/database/offlinechatprocessorconversationconfig/) and click *Enable* on the Offline Chat configuration.
2. Open your [Chat model options](http://localhost:42110/server/admin/database/chatmodeloptions/) and add a new option for the offline chat model you want to use. Make sure to use `Offline` as its type. We currently only support offline models that use the [Llama chat prompt](https://replicate.com/blog/how-to-prompt-llama#wrap-user-input-with-inst-inst-tags) format. We recommend using `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_0.gguf`.


:::tip[Note]
Offline chat is not supported for a multi-user scenario. The host machine will encounter segmentation faults if multiple users try to use offline chat at the same time.
:::

#### Online Chat
Online chat requires internet to use ChatGPT but is faster, higher quality and less compute intensive.

:::danger[Warning]
This will enable Khoj to send your chat queries and query relevant notes to OpenAI for processing.
:::

1. Get your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
2. Open your [Khoj Online Chat settings](http://localhost:42110/server/admin/database/openaiprocessorconversationconfig/). Add a new setting with your OpenAI API key, and click *Save*. Only one configuration will be used, so make sure that's the only one you have.
3. Open your [Chat model options](http://localhost:42110/server/admin/database/chatmodeloptions/) and add a new option for the OpenAI chat model you want to use. Make sure to use `OpenAI` as its type.
